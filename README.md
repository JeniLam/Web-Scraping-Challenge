# Web-Scraping-Challenge



## Summary

This project was to build a flask web application that scrapes various websites for details regarding the Mars Mission.  The scraped data would display on a single HTML page. Flask was used to push the scraped data to the HTML while simultaneously saving the scraped data into a MongoDB.
